# Kirkepostil
Kirkepostil is an clone of [`BlogiNote`](https://github.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote) from [`Benbinbin`](https://github.com/Benbinbin), that is a hidden treasure, like the treasure in the Bible, hidden for the wise and prudent. Matt 11, 25.

Everyone write about the setup in the readme-file, please go away to read about it, (it's the same everywhere) or google about it - like me, when I started for some months ago on GitHub.

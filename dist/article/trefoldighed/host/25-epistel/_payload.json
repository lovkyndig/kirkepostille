Hvis arven fås på grund af loven, fås den ikke mere på grund af løftet. Men det var ved et løfte, Gud gav Abraham arven. Hvad skulle så loven? Den blev føjet til for overtrædelsernes skyld, men den skulle kun være gyldig, indtil det afkom, som havde fået løftet, var kommet. Den blev givet ved engle, gennem en formidler.
